1. Load and Preprocess Data

You'll need to load your data into R and preprocess it to get it ready for analysis. This usually involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and converting variables to the correct data types.

R
# Load necessary libraries
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(forecast)
library(ggplot2)

# Load the data
data <- read_csv("path/to/your/data.csv")

# Convert 'date' to a date type and set it as the row names
data$date <- as.Date(data$date)
row.names(data) <- data$date

# Select the 'demand' column and convert to a time series
demand_ts <- ts(data$demand, start = c(2020, 1), frequency = 365)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis

Next, you'll want to explore your data to understand its structure and the relationships between variables. This could involve visualizing the data, checking for trends or seasonality, and computing descriptive statistics.

R
# Plot the time series
autoplot(demand_ts) +
  ggtitle("Electricity Demand Over Time") +
  xlab("Time") +
  ylab("Demand")
Save to grepper
3. Time Series Decomposition

Decomposing the time series can help you understand its underlying patterns. You can separate the time series into its trend, seasonal, and residual components.

R

# Decompose the time series
decomposed <- stl(demand_ts, s.window="periodic")

# Plot the decomposed time series
autoplot(decomposed)

4. Model Fitting and Forecasting

Next, you'll fit a model to your data and use it to make forecasts. You might choose a model like an ARIMA or Exponential Smoothing model, depending on the characteristics of your data.

R

# Fit an ARIMA model to the data
fit <- auto.arima(demand_ts)

# Forecast the next 30 days
forecasted <- forecast(fit, h=30)

# Plot the forecast
autoplot(forecasted)

5. Model Evaluation

Finally, you'll want to evaluate how well your model performed. This could involve computing error metrics, checking the residuals of your model, and comparing your forecasts to actual values.

R

# Compute accuracy measures
accuracy(forecasted)

# Check residuals
checkresiduals(fit)
